<br>
This is a Exploratory Data Analysis Project, where I have used the kaggle dataset to explore and gain insights on the grocery dataset.

I have used various libraries such as, seaborn, matplotlib etc to visualize the data in sub regions, based on the features.

The notebook contains the detailed overview and the conclusions that are drawn from the analysis.
